# Web Infrastructure Design Project

## Overview

This project explores the design and evolution of web infrastructure, taking a step-by-step approach to understanding how websites are built and scaled. Through a series of increasingly complex designs, we'll examine the key components, challenges, and considerations in modern web architecture.

## Tasks

### 0. Simple Web Stack üåê
**Objective:** Design a basic single-server web infrastructure

#### Key Components:
- 1 Server
- Nginx Web Server
- Application Server
- MySQL Database
- Domain Configuration (www.foobar.com)

**Learning Focus:**
- Understanding fundamental web infrastructure roles
- Exploring component interactions
- Identifying initial system limitations

**Challenges Addressed:**
- Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
- Limited scalability
- Maintenance complexities

### 1. Distributed Web Infrastructure üîÄ
**Objective:** Enhance infrastructure with multiple servers and load balancing

#### New Elements:
- 2 Servers
- Load Balancer (HAproxy)
- Distributed Application Components
- Primary-Replica Database Cluster

**Learning Focus:**
- Load balancing algorithms
- High availability concepts
- Database replication strategies

**Challenges Addressed:**
- Improved fault tolerance
- Basic traffic distribution
- Initial scalability improvements

### 2. Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure üîí
**Objective:** Add security and monitoring layers to the infrastructure

#### Security and Monitoring Additions:
- 3 Firewalls
- SSL Certificate (HTTPS)
- Monitoring Clients (e.g., Sumologic)

**Learning Focus:**
- Web security principles
- Encrypted traffic management
- Performance and health monitoring

**Challenges Addressed:**
- Network security
- Data encryption
- Comprehensive system observability

### 3. Scale Up (Advanced) üìà
**Objective:** Further modularize and prepare for massive scalability

#### Architectural Improvements:
- Dedicated servers for each component
- Clustered load balancers
- Complete service separation

**Learning Focus:**
- Advanced scaling strategies
- Component-level optimization
- Preparing for enterprise-level infrastructure
