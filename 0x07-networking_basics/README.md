# 0x07. Networking basics #2

## Description
This project delves into additional networking concepts, focusing on subnetting, IP address types, and the OSI model. The tasks will enhance your understanding of network design and IP management, expanding your ability to troubleshoot, manage, and configure network environments effectively.

**Manual pages or commands:**
- `ip`
- `ping`
- `netstat`

## Requirements
| **Category**         | **Details**                                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Editors**          | `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`                               |
| **Operating System** | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS                                   |
| **File Endings**     | All files should end with a new line               |
| **README**           | A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory |
| **Bash Scripts**     | All Bash scripts must be executable                |
| **Shellcheck**       | Scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without errors |
| **Shebang**          | All scripts should start with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` |
| **Script Comments**  | The second line of each script should describe its purpose |

### Bash Script Guidelines
- Ensure all scripts are tested and function as intended.
- Always include comments for clarity and to explain complex logic.
- Follow Shellcheck standards to ensure quality and maintainability.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Explain the purpose of IP addresses and their classes.
- Distinguish between private and public IP addresses.
- Describe subnetting and how it improves network efficiency.
- Understand the OSI model, particularly focusing on Layer 3 (Network) and Layer 4 (Transport).

## Tasks
