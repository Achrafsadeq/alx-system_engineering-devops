 # 0x0E. Web Stack Debugging #1

## Background Context

This project focuses on debugging and fixing issues related to the Nginx web server configuration. By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience with debugging web server issues and automating fixes using Bash scripts.

## Requirements

| Category         | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| **Project Type** | Mandatory |
| **Review**       | Manually reviewed by peers or TAs |
| **Nginx Version** | Nginx (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS) |
| **README**       | A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory |
| **File Extension** | All Bash scripts must end with `.sh` |

## General Requirements

1. **Bash Scripts**: All Bash scripts must be executable and pass `shellcheck` without any errors.
2. **File Structure**: All files should end with a new line, and the first line of each Bash script must be a comment explaining its purpose.
3. **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**: All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
4. **Nginx Configuration**: Nginx must be running and listening on port 80 of all the server's active IPv4 IPs.

## Tasks

| Task                          | Description                                  | Files                         |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **0. Nginx likes port 80**     | Debug and fix the Nginx configuration to listen on port 80 | `0-nginx_likes_port_80` |
| **1. Make it sweet and short** | Create a shorter version of the fix script (5 lines or less) | `1-debugging_made_short` |

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Understand how to debug web server issues.
- Learn how to configure Nginx to listen on specific ports.
- Gain experience with automating fixes using Bash scripts.
- Develop skills in writing concise and efficient Bash scripts.
