# 0x18. Webstack Monitoring

## Background Context
Monitoring your web stack is crucial for ensuring the reliability, performance, and availability of your services. In this project, you will learn how to set up monitoring for your web stack using Datadog, a popular monitoring and analytics platform. You will also learn how to create dashboards and set up monitors to track key metrics.
