# 0x15. API

## Background Context

This project focuses on interacting with APIs using Python. You will learn how to gather data from an API, export it to CSV and JSON formats, and manipulate the data to meet specific requirements. By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience with Python's `requests` or `urllib` libraries, as well as working with JSON and CSV files.

## Requirements

| Category         | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| **Project Type** | Mandatory |
| **Review**       | Manually reviewed by peers or TAs |
| **Environment**  | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS |
| **README**       | A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory |
| **File Extension** | All Python scripts must end with `.py` |

## General Requirements

1. **Python Version**: All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
2. **File Structure**: All files should end with a new line, and the first line of each Python script must be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
3. **Libraries**: Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order.
4. **Code Style**: Your code should use `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*).
5. **Documentation**: All modules should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'` to check).
6. **Execution**: Your code should not be executed when imported (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`).

## Tasks

| Task                          | Description                                  | Files                         |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **0. Gather data from an API** | Write a Python script that fetches and displays an employee's TODO list progress | `0-gather_data_from_an_API.py` |
| **1. Export to CSV**          | Extend the script to export the TODO list data to a CSV file | `1-export_to_CSV.py` |
| **2. Export to JSON**         | Extend the script to export the TODO list data to a JSON file | `2-export_to_JSON.py` |
| **3. Dictionary of list of dictionaries** | Extend the script to export all employees' TODO list data to a JSON file | `3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries.py` |
