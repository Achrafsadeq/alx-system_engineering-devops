# 0x11. What Happens When You Type `https://www.google.com` in Your Browser and Press Enter?

## Background Context

This project is designed to deepen your understanding of how the web stack works by exploring the sequence of events that occur when you type a URL like `https://www.google.com` into your browser and press Enter. By completing this project, you will gain insights into DNS resolution, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases. You will also create a blog post and a diagram to explain the process, and optionally contribute to an open-source repository.

## Requirements

| Category         | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| **Project Type** | Mandatory |
| **Review**       | Manually reviewed by peers or TAs |
| **Blog Platform**| Medium or LinkedIn |
| **README**       | A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory |
| **Language**     | English |

## General Requirements

1. **Blog Post**: Write a detailed blog post explaining what happens when you type `https://www.google.com` in your browser and press Enter. The post must cover:
   - DNS request
   - TCP/IP
   - Firewall
   - HTTPS/SSL
   - Load-balancer
   - Web server
   - Application server
   - Database

2. **Diagram**: Create a diagram illustrating the flow of the request. The diagram should show:
   - DNS resolution
   - The request hitting the server IP on the appropriate port
   - Traffic encryption
   - Traffic passing through a firewall
   - Request distribution via a load balancer
   - The web server answering the request by serving a web page
   - The application server generating the web page
   - The application server requesting data from the database

3. **Contribution**: Optionally, contribute to the open-source repository [what-happens-when](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when) by submitting a pull request that adds meaningful value.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Understand the end-to-end process of what happens when you type a URL into your browser and press Enter.
- Gain knowledge of key web technologies such as DNS, TCP/IP, HTTPS/SSL, firewalls, load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases.
- Improve your technical writing skills by creating a detailed blog post.
- Enhance your ability to visualize complex processes by creating a diagram.
- Contribute to open-source projects, improving your collaboration and version control skills.
