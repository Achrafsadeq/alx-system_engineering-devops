# 0x16. API Advanced

## Background Context

This project builds on the foundational knowledge of interacting with APIs using Python. It delves deeper into more advanced API interactions, focusing on querying, parsing, and manipulating data from the Reddit API. By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience with Python's `requests` library, recursion, and advanced data handling techniques.

## Requirements

| Category         | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| **Project Type** | Mandatory |
| **Review**       | Manually reviewed by peers or TAs |
| **Environment**  | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS |
| **README**       | A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory |
| **File Extension** | All Python scripts must end with `.py` |

## General Requirements

1. **Python Version**: All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
2. **File Structure**: All files should end with a new line, and the first line of each Python script must be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
3. **Libraries**: Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order.
4. **Code Style**: Your code should use `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*).
5. **Documentation**: All modules should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'` to check).
6. **Execution**: Your code should not be executed when imported (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`).

## Tasks

| Task                          | Description                                  | Files                         |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **0. How many subs?**         | Write a function that queries the Reddit API and returns the number of subscribers for a given subreddit | `0-subs.py` |
| **1. Top Ten**                | Write a function that queries the Reddit API and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts for a given subreddit | `1-top_ten.py` |
| **2. Recurse it!**            | Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API and returns a list of titles of all hot articles for a given subreddit | `2-recurse.py` |
| **3. Count it!**              | Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API, parses the titles of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords | `100-count.py` |
