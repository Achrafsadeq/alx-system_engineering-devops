# 2. Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

## Task Overview

### Scenario
Design a robust, secure, and observable web infrastructure for `www.foobar.com` that prioritizes data protection, encrypted communication, and comprehensive system monitoring.

## Infrastructure Components

| Component | Quantity | Purpose | Security/Monitoring Enhancement |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------------------------------|
| Firewalls | 3 | Network security | Protect against unauthorized access |
| SSL Certificate | 1 | Encryption | Secure data transmission |
| Monitoring Clients | 3 | System observability | Real-time performance tracking |
| Servers | 3 | Host web components | Distributed and redundant setup |
| Web Server (Nginx) | 1 | Handle web requests | Secure request processing |
| Application Server | 1 | Process application logic | Isolated application environment |
| Load Balancer | 1 | Traffic distribution | Centralized traffic management |
| Database (MySQL) | 1 | Data management | Controlled data operations |

## Security Mechanisms

### Firewalls
#### Purpose
- Filter incoming/outgoing network traffic
- Block potential security threats
- Control access based on predefined rules

#### Types of Protection
- Packet filtering
- Stateful inspection
- Application-level gateway
- Network address translation (NAT)

### SSL/HTTPS Encryption
#### Benefits
- Encrypts data in transit
- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- Ensures data integrity
- Builds user trust
- Protects sensitive information

#### Encryption Process
1. SSL certificate validates website identity
2. Establishes encrypted communication channel
3. Uses public/private key cryptography
4. Negotiates secure connection parameters

## Monitoring Infrastructure

### Monitoring Clients (e.g., Sumologic)
#### Data Collection Methods
- Log aggregation
- Metric collection
- Real-time performance tracking
- Event and error monitoring

#### Monitored Metrics
- Server resource utilization
- Network performance
- Application response times
- Error rates
- Traffic volume

### Web Server QPS (Queries Per Second) Monitoring
1. Configure monitoring agent
2. Collect Nginx access logs
3. Analyze request rate
4. Set up dashboard/alerts
5. Track peak and average loads

## Infrastructure Workflow
1. User requests `www.foobar.com`
2. Firewall validates connection
3. Load balancer routes request
4. SSL encrypts data transmission
5. Server processes request
6. Monitoring agents track performance
7. Encrypted response returned

## Infrastructure Limitations

### SSL Termination Challenges
- Potential security vulnerabilities
- Increased load balancer complexity
- Reduced end-to-end encryption
- Performance overhead

### Database Write Limitations
- Single point of write failure
- Potential data synchronization issues
- Limited write-scaling capabilities

### Homogeneous Server Configuration
- Reduced fault tolerance
- Increased vulnerability surface
- Limited specialized optimization
- Challenging maintenance and updates

## Improvement Recommendations
- Implement multi-master database
- Use end-to-end encryption
- Introduce server role specialization
- Develop advanced monitoring dashboards
- Implement dynamic firewall rules
- Create automated security patches

## Learning Objectives
- Understand comprehensive web security
- Explore monitoring and observability
- Develop secure infrastructure design skills
- Recognize complex system interactions

## Submission Requirements
- Whiteboard detailed infrastructure design
- Capture comprehensive screenshot
- Explain security and monitoring mechanisms
- Discuss potential improvement strategies
