# 0x05. Processes and Signals

## Description

This project focuses on understanding and working with processes and signals in a Unix-like environment. You'll learn how to handle process IDs, send signals, and use tools for process control in Bash scripts. Through these tasks, youâ€™ll gain experience in managing process states, utilizing signals, and working with basic system calls.

## Requirements

|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Editors                 | `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`                                     |
| Interpreter             | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS                                         |
| File Endings            | All files should end with a new line                     |
| README                  | A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory |
| Coding Style            | All Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0)    |
| Script Permissions      | All Bash scripts must be executable                      |
| Header Line             | `#!/usr/bin/env bash`                                    |
| Global Variables        | Not allowed                                              |
| Comment Requirement     | Second line of all scripts must explain the script's function |

## Bash Scripting Guidelines

* All Bash scripts must start with `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
* Shellcheck must pass without any error for all scripts.
* Use best practices for readability and efficiency, especially when handling process and signal-related commands.
* Avoid complex commands unless necessary to fulfill task requirements.

## Tasks

| Task Number | Description                                                          | File Name               |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 0           | Write a script that displays its own PID.                            | `0-what-is-my-pid`      |
| 1           | Write a script that lists currently running processes for all users. | `1-list_your_processes` |
| 2           | Write a script that displays the PID of a given process name.        | `2-show_pid`            |
| 3           | Write a script that creates a process that sleeps indefinitely.      | `3-infinite_loop`       |
| 4           | Write a script that kills a process by PID.                          | `4-kill_me_now`         |
| 5           | Write a script that kills multiple instances of a process by name.   | `5-kill_me_now_again`   |
| 6           | Write a script to use signals to stop and continue a process.        | `6-signal_me`           |
| 7           | Write a script to handle `SIGTERM` signal with a message.            | `7-stop_me_if_you_can`  |
| 8           | Write a script to catch and report specific signals for a process.   | `8-catch_me_if_you_can` |

## Advanced Tasks

| Task Number | Description                                                          | File Name               |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 100         | Write a script that listens for specific signals and logs them.      | `100-signal_listener`   |
| 101         | Implement a script that restarts itself upon receiving `SIGHUP`.     | `101-reload_me`         |
| 102         | Write a script that creates a process tree view of running processes.| `102-process_tree`      |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

* Retrieve and use process IDs with `ps` and other commands.
* Send signals to processes and handle them within scripts.
* Create and manage background processes.
* Use Shellcheck to ensure all scripts adhere to best practices.
* Develop scripts that handle specific system signals to control process behavior.
