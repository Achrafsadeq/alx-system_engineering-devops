# 3. Scaled Web Infrastructure

## Task Overview

### Scenario
Expanding the web infrastructure for `www.foobar.com` to handle increased load and improve reliability through component separation and load balancing.

## Infrastructure Components

| Component | Description | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Server 1 | Web Server | Hosts Nginx for static content |
| Server 2 | Application Server | Runs application logic |
| Server 3 | Database Server | Dedicated MySQL host |
| Server 4 | Additional Server | Secondary application node |
| Load Balancer (HAproxy) | Traffic distributor | Cluster configuration |

## Architectural Workflow
1. User requests reach load balancer cluster
2. HAproxy distributes traffic between servers
3. Web servers handle static content
4. Application servers process dynamic requests
5. Database server manages data operations
6. Response returns through same path

## Detailed Component Explanations

### Additional Server
- Provides redundancy and scalability
- Hosts duplicate application components
- Enables horizontal scaling
- Improves system reliability

### Load Balancer (HAproxy)
- Distributes incoming traffic
- Configured in cluster mode
- Provides high availability
- Monitors server health
- Implements failover mechanisms

### Component Separation
- Web server on dedicated machine
- Application server isolation
- Database on separate hardware
- Improved resource management
- Enhanced security isolation

## Infrastructure Benefits

### High Availability
- Redundant application servers
- Clustered load balancers
- Automatic failover capability
- Minimized downtime risk

### Improved Performance
- Dedicated resource allocation
- Optimized component operation
- Better resource utilization
- Reduced contention

### Enhanced Security
- Component isolation
- Separate security policies
- Reduced attack surface
- Controlled access points

## Design Considerations

### Load Distribution
- Round-robin algorithm
- Health monitoring
- Session persistence
- Dynamic server pools

### Server Specialization
- Optimized configurations
- Component-specific tuning
- Resource allocation
- Performance optimization

### Network Architecture
- Internal network segments
- Security zones
- Traffic routing
- Access controls

## Technical Specifications

### HAproxy Configuration

- Statistics monitoring

### Server Requirements
- Sufficient CPU/RAM
- Fast storage systems
- Network capacity
- Monitoring capabilities

### Network Design
- VLAN segmentation
- Firewall rules
- Traffic routing
- Backup connectivity

## Learning Objectives
- Understand scalable architecture
- Master load balancing concepts
- Learn component separation
- Implement high availability

## Submission Requirements
- Infrastructure diagram
- Component explanation
- Scaling rationale
- Technical documentation
