# 0x06. Regular Expressions

## Description
This project covers the creation and usage of regular expressions (regex) in Ruby. It includes tasks designed to familiarize you with constructing regex patterns and integrating them into Ruby scripts. The focus is on using regex to match specific patterns in strings, utilizing the Oniguruma regex library (default for Ruby). This project also adheres to the required coding standards and conventions.

## Requirements
| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Editors** | `vi`, `vim`, `emacs` |
| **Interpreter** | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `ruby` (version 2.7.0) |
| **File Endings** | All files should end with a new line |
| **README** | A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory |
| **Coding Style** | Rubyâ€™s standard styling conventions |
| **Global Variables** | Not allowed |
| **Functions per File** | No more than 5 |
| **Allowed Ruby Standard Library Functions** | `puts`, `print` |
| **Regex Library** | Oniguruma (default for Ruby) |

### Ruby Coding Guidelines
- All Ruby scripts must be executable.
- All scripts should begin with `#!/usr/bin/env ruby` as the first line.
- Ensure regex patterns are compatible with the Oniguruma library.
- Scripts should be tested against various cases to ensure they match the expected patterns accurately.

## Tasks
| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| **0** | Match the word "School" | `0-simply_match_school.rb` |
| **1** | Match a repetitive token pattern | `1-repetition_token_0.rb` |
| **2** | Match a different repetitive token pattern | `2-repetition_token_1.rb` |
| **3** | Match another repetitive token pattern | `3-repetition_token_2.rb` |
| **4** | Match a specific repetitive pattern without square brackets | `4-repetition_token_3.rb` |
| **5** | Match a string that starts with 'h' and ends with 'n' with any single character in between | `5-beginning_and_end.rb` |
| **6** | Match a 10-digit phone number | `6-phone_number.rb` |
| **7** | Match only uppercase letters | `7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb` |

## Advanced Tasks
| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| **100** | Extract sender, receiver, and flags information | `100-textme.rb` |

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Design and use regular expressions effectively.
- Apply regex to solve common text-matching problems.
- Integrate regex with Ruby scripts for text processing.
- Understand and utilize the Oniguruma library for regex in Ruby.
